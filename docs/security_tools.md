### Visualization

- [Piet](https://github.com/slockit/piet) - Web application helping understand smart contract architectures. Offers graphical representation and inspection of smart contracts as well as a markdown documentation generator.
- [Sūrya](https://github.com/ConsenSys/surya) - Utility tool for smart contract systems, offering a number of visual outputs and information about the contracts' structure. Also supports querying the function call graph.
- [Solgraph](https://github.com/raineorshine/solgraph) - Generates a DOT graph that visualizes function control flow of a Solidity contract and highlights potential security vulnerabilities.
- [EVM Lab](https://github.com/ethereum/evmlab) - Rich tool package to interact with the EVM. Includes a VM, Etherchain API, and a trace-viewer.
- [ethereum-graph-debugger](https://github.com/fergarrui/ethereum-graph-debugger) - A graphical EVM debugger. Displays the entire program control flow graph.

### Static and Dynamic Analysis

- [MythX](https://mythx.io) - Professional security analysis tools and extensions for [Truffle](https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle-security), [Embark](https://github.com/flex-dapps/embark-mythx) and other environments ([awesome list](https://github.com/b-mueller/awesome-mythx-smart-contract-security-tools)).
- [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril) - The Swiss army knife for smart contract security.
- [Slither](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither) - Static analysis framework with detectors for many common Solidity issues. It has taint and value tracking capabilities and is written in Python.
- [Echidna](https://github.com/trailofbits/echidna) - The only available fuzzer for Ethereum software. Uses property testing to generate malicious inputs that break smart contracts.
- [Manticore](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore) - Dynamic binary analysis tool with [EVM support](https://asciinema.org/a/haJU2cl0R0Q3jB9wd733LVosL).
- [Oyente](https://github.com/melonproject/oyente) - Analyze Ethereum code to find common vulnerabilities, based on this [paper](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~loiluu/papers/oyente.pdf).
- [Securify](https://securify.chainsecurity.com/) - Fully automated online static analyzer for smart contracts, providing a security report based on vulnerability patterns.
- [SmartCheck](https://tool.smartdec.net) - Static analysis of Solidity source code for security vulnerabilities and best practices.
- [Octopus](https://github.com/quoscient/octopus) - Security Analysis tool for Blockchain Smart Contracts with support of EVM and (e)WASM.

### Weakness OSSClassifcation & Test Cases
- [SWC-registry](https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/SWC-registry/) - SWC definitions and a large repository of crafted and real-world samples of vulnerable smart contracts.
- [SWC Pages](https://smartcontractsecurity.github.io/SWC-registry/) - The SWC-registry repo published on Github Pages

### Test Coverage

- [solidity-coverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage) - Code coverage for Solidity testing.

### Linters

Linters improve code quality by enforcing rules for style and composition, making code easier to read and review.

- [Solcheck](https://github.com/federicobond/solcheck) - A linter for Solidity code written in JS and heavily inspired by eslint.
- [Solint](https://github.com/weifund/solint) - Solidity linting that helps you enforce consistent conventions and avoid errors in your Solidity smart-contracts.
- [Solium](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Solium) - Yet another Solidity linting.
- [Solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint) - A linter for Solidity that provides both Security and Style Guide validations.
