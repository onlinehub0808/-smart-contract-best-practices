# Ethereum Smart Contract Security Best Practices

This document provides a baseline knowledge of security considerations for intermediate Solidity programmers. It is maintained by [ConsenSys Diligence](https://consensys.net/diligence/), with contributions from our friends in the broader Ethereum community.

Our amazing community has also provided translations in [Chinese](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices/blob/master/README-zh.md) and [Vietnamese](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices/blob/master/README-vi.md).

## Where to start?

* [General Philosophy](./general_philosophy.md) describes the smart contract security mindset
* [Smart Contract Recommendations](./recommendations.md) contains examples of good code patterns
