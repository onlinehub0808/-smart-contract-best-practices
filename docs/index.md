# Ethereum Smart Contract Security Best Practices

This document provides a baseline knowledge of security considerations for intermediate Solidity
programmers. It is maintained by [ConsenSys Diligence](https://consensys.net/diligence/), with
contributions from our friends in the broader Ethereum community.

Our amazing community has also provided translations in
[Chinese](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices/blob/master/README-zh.md) and
[Vietnamese](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices/blob/master/README-vi.md).

## Where to start?

- [General Philosophy](./zen-of-smart-contract-security.md) describes the smart contract security mindset
- [Smart Contract Recommendations](./recommendations.md) contains examples of good code patterns
- [Known Attacks](./known_attacks.md) describes the different classes of vulnerabilities to avoid
- [Software Engineering](./software_engineering.md) outlines some architectural and design
  approaches for risk mitigation
- [Tokens](./tokens.md) outlines best practices specifically related to Tokens.
- [Documentation and Procedures](./documentation_procedures.md) outlines best practices for
  documenting your system for other developers and auditors
- [Security Tools](./security-tools.md) lists tools for improving code quality, and detecting
  vulnerabilities
- [Bug Bounties](./bug-bounty-programs.md) List of bug bounties in the ecosystem.
