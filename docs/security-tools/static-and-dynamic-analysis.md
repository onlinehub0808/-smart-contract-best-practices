- [MythX](https://mythx.io) - MythX is a professional-grade cloud service that uses symbolic
  analysis and input fuzzing to
  [detect common security bugs](https://medium.com/consensys-diligence/detecting-the-top-4-critical-smart-contract-vulnerabilities-with-mythx-9c568d7db7a6)
  and
  [verify the correctness of smart contract code](https://medium.com/coinmonks/advanced-smart-contract-security-verification-in-remix-9630b43695e5).
  Using MythX requires an API key from [mythx.io](https://mythx.io).
