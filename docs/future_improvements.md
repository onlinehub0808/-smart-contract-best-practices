### Functional languages

Functional languages give certain guarantees over procedural languages like Solidity, namely immutability within a function and strong compile time checking. This can reduce the risk of errors by providing deterministic behavior (for more see [this](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cmqejp6d43n5cqkdl3iu0582f4k), Curry-Howard correspondence, and linear logic).
