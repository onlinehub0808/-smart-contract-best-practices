## Security Tools

- [Oyente](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~loiluu/papers/oyente.pdf), an upcoming tool, will analyze Ethereum code to find common vulnerabilities (e.g., Transaction Order Dependence, no checking for exceptions)

- [Solgraph](https://github.com/raineorshine/solgraph) - Generates a DOT graph that visualizes function control flow of a Solidity contract and highlights potential security vulnerabilities.
